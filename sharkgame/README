Assignment 2
Joshua Campbell

To compile the program, do make.
To run the program do make run.
To clean the program, do make clean.

The program takes in an image and displays it, fills the background with a
color, uses the SDL_rect class to fill part of the screen with color. It
utilizes the game loop and game engine class with the additional game
object helper class to run the game. Input is allowed and 2 different control
metaphors are implemented to show off 2 different types of control.

To change the control metaphor:
Press the 1 key to activate the Velocity Control Metaphor
Press the 2 key to activate the Position Control Metaphor

Once a control metaphor is selected:
Up to move the character up
Down to move the character down
Left to move the character left
Right to move the character right

When in Velocity Control Metaphor mode, the shark has a tail flopping sprite
animation. When in Position Control Metaphor, the shark will have an eating
sprite animation.

The Tile Manager takes the water tile to be used for the background and then
is applied.

The fish represent the collectible.

NEW WITH ASSN4:

Bubbles were added for the particles section. Both particle and particleEmitter
classes were added. The bubbles spawn at the ocean floor and rise up animating
back and forth until they go away randomly and respawn at the bottom.

A collision detection class was added that used the box collider method from
the lecture. It takes in 2 rects and compares the sides for overlap. 

There is a collision response when the shark collides with the seafloor. The
shark will stop moving down and cannot move into the floor.
